# *✉️⚠️ Spam Classifier: different approaches*

<br>

### ***◼️ First Approach:*** The first detector was built using the spacy module and the machine learning model Random Forest Classifier.

### ***◼️ Second Approach:*** The second detector uses the tools offered by Keras to construct a sequential neural network.

### ***◼️ Third Approach:*** The difference between this method and the other ones is that, besides utilizing Keras and building a neural network, it is also created an customized embedding layer and a tokenizer that transform the messages text into sequences of integers in a fixed length that will be read by the NN.
